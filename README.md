# Rust Projects

These are links to projects from the ["Programming with Rust"](https://fmi.rust-lang.bg/) course of the Sofia University in Bulgaria.

The elective course includes 23(ish) lectures spread out over 4 months or so. The students have homework assignments to practice Rust, and, at the end, present a project of their own choosing using the language. Here are some of them:

- [Console](#console)
