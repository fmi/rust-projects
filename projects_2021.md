> You're playing as a snake livng on a small hexagonal island in the The Big Void. You're lonely and hungry. There's no one else there with you, but there's always exactly one apple. You're goal is to roam the land and eat as many as you can. But beware of the island edges - once you fall you're journey's over! You hope that once you become bigger and stronger you could finally leave. But you'll soon find out that that has its consequences too...

> Words are coming from the left side of the screen and go to the right. The player should write the incoming words without typo and earn points. If you leave a word to get to the right side of the screen you lose 1 life. If you lose all of your lives -> Game Over :/. The question is how far can you get and how much points you can earn? :)
